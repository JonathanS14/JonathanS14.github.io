	<p> The next game displayed is Outlaw Showdown. In this game you play as the blue cowboy. Repeatedly
	hit the space bar to defeat the outlaw. Be careful though, if you aren't fast enough the Outlaw wins.
	This game was created by Thepizzaplac using scratch and the piskel app.</p>



	<p> The third and final game is a collaboration game between the makers of the other two games.
	In this game you will be squaring off with a friend in the ultimate battle of strength and will.
	When the 3 second countdown ends player 1 will begin mashing the W and S key, while player 2 will
	begin mashing the Up and Down Arrow keys and after 10 seconds one player will be declared victorius.</p>
